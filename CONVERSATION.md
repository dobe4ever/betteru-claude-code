Intro:

I’m new to all the technologies used in this app. Its literally my first time writing react, or JS, TS, html, css, tailwind, as well as first time using supabase, vercel, google auth, and everything else. My background is exclusively python. I’m saying this because I don’t want you to take my codebase as an example of how things need to be done (unless they are already perfect). You need to take full charge as the lead dev, understand my intention and extract all the info you need from me, like you would with a not so technical client. Respect how the app looks in terms of branding & obvious features, but do plan for a code refactor or restructure if needed based on best practices.

Today’s mission:

Get a basic version of the essential front end and back end working via vercel that will work for any user, and its ready to give it the real domain url which was already purchased by the client. (https://betteryoueveryday.app/ ).

This general mission has 3 parts that need to implement the back end based on the existing front ends. Consider a front end refactor but respect how everything looks & functions so far from the user perspective. Simply put, implement the backend for the front end, while optimizing the entire codebase. Here’s the 3 main sub-missions:

Users: Create, collect, store, fetch, display, user related data such as user personal into, user account info, user custom settings, and whatever else.

Habits: After the user related data is done, collect the user’s associated ‘habits’ data. I will explain when we get there but there’s individual habits the user can create, edit, and delete from the daily list of habits. There’s several front end UI’s within the ‘habits’ context, all related & dependent on each other to collect, use, and display the data on different components such as the habit widget, habits list, habit card, challenge card, and more.

Analytics: Once we’re collecting both, users, and user’s habit’s data, we can start to track progress and things and display some useful analytics.

The app is infinitely larger than this 3 features, but these are the essential features to make the most basic yet fully functional first version, then keep extending it from there.

Lets start with 1. Users:

Sub-tasks:

Authentication with email & google (front & back end)

All other databases/tables/ backends to store persistent data

Once the functionality works 10%, improve UI & UX for all this from the user’s point of view.

Where we’re at currently within the ‘users’ context of the app:



I can login with googe & email. Need to test creating new account. Here’s some observations during the google login screens:

1:

Choose an account

to continue to qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co

…

2:

Sign in to qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co

helsola8@gmail.com

By continuing, Google will share your name, email address, language preference, and profile picture with qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co. See qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

You can manage Sign in with Google in your Google Account.

Initial issues to address:



General: The user shouldn’t see: continue to [qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co](http://qrasyvzjblemmjqjvdll.supabase.co "‌")…\ Should see the the app url [https://betteru-claude-code.vercel.app](https://betteru-claude-code.vercel.app "‌")

From android Phone & laptop: After google login from android phone i get ERROR 403 forbidden at the google/oauth/consent?authuser=xxx url. I close the page, go to the app url again, i chose login with google and now it knows its me so it logs me in and redirects me to the app’s home screen right away: [https://betteru-claude-code.vercel.app](https://betteru-claude-code.vercel.app "‌"). the logout button in side the profile menu from the topbar works. I can also edit the profile pic & name but its not storing the pic permanently in supabase. After logout & log back in, there’s the ‘no avatar’ thing with my initial from my google account, altho the edited name is not the public google name, the edited name does persist.

Edge case: Sometimes I get ‘Auth session missing!' when trying to edit profile and doesn’t let me save changes, in addition to the logout button not working. It happened on and off on different & same browsers so I’m not sure if it has to do with being logged in in too many places at once or something else but doesn’t see to be browser or device specific.

in the codespaces integrated preview, i can only login with email and password, google gives me “403. That’s an error. We're sorry, but you do not have access to this page. That’s all we know.” But if I open the same url in a new tab, i can login with google (https://supreme-space-fiesta-rjwp5wx9j9ghjw4-3000.app.github.dev)

We’ll worry about the next tasks later, let’s address things in baby steps and make sure to implement and test every little thing before moving to the next.

Questions:

How will I be able to test front end with back end via the codespaces preview if the URL and maybe more details are different from the production app deployed to vercel?
